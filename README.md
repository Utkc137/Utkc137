## Team Number: 41 - SMIT Events App
### Project Overview
---------------------------------- 
* Create an app to store the details of all recent, current and future events
* An app for viewing, updating, deleting, and adding events to be created

### Solution Description
----------------------------------
The app opens to the home page, which has 4 buttons. The first 3 buttons are for the events on the basis of upcoming, previous and ongoing. The last button is to the login page. The login page requires any username and password, and once logged in, the user can update and modify the database created using sqllite. The user can also request for new events on that screen. On the homepage, the buttons for the events take you to different activities with a list of all the events with a small description about the event.

#### Technical Description
* Android Studio, JDK, Backend: Kotlin and Java, Frontend: XML
* Used an emulator to run the app on the computer
* Homepage buttons take you to the events list, events lists take you to the description of the specifically selected event. The other button on the homepage takes you to the login page where, once logged in, you can update and modify the database, and request for more events.
